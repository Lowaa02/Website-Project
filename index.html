          <h2>Amesame!!!</h2>
          <p>Gura is close friends with Watson Amelia. 
            In one stream, Gura sang You Are My Sunshine but 
            changed the lyrics to be about Amelia. The pair often 
            collab together and are most commonly shipped together 
            under the name and Twitter tag "#amesame".</p>
            <p>Gawr Gura's intro theme was originally commissioned for 
              Watson Amelia. Ame ended up not using the music, so Gura used 
              it instead.</p>

          <h2>Gura's Age???</h2>
          <p> Gura has trouble remembering her own age.</p>
          <p>*In her debut stream, she first gave her age as 
            "somewhere in the 9,000s [...] I'll go with 9,361, yeah, 
            we'll go with that.</p>
            <p>*On 13 October 2020, she gave her age as 4,295, 9,495, and 9,485.</p>
            <p>*On 28 April 2021, during a Monster Hunter Rise stream, she gave her age as 9,927.</p>
            <p>*In her 2021 birthday collab stream, she claimed to be 9,655, then 
              agreed when Anya Melfissa said 9,600.</p>
            <p>*During the 2023 birthday stream itself, she sang 
              "Happy birthday to me, I'm 9,303.</p>

          <h2>Her Genmate (Myth)</h2>
          <p>In Japanese, Gura's name is written 「がうる・ぐら」 ("gauru gura").</p>
          <p>She gives her surname first, Japanese style, even when speaking in English. 
            Takanashi Kiara and Ninomae Ina'nis also do this, while Calliope Mori and 
            Amelia Watson use the English name order when speaking in English.</p>
            <p>Her surname Gawr comes from the gar, an ancient holosteian 
              order of ray-finned fish. Her first name Gura comes from the Latin gula,
               meaning "gluttony."</p>
               <p>Gura is the only member of holoMyth to write her name entirely 
                in hiragana. This is consistent with her childlike demeanor and 
                academic skills, since hiragana-only writing is usually reserved 
                for children's books.</p>

          <h2>Retirement...</h2>
          <p>Gawr Gura is known as the shark-girl VTuber to 
            her many fans and nearly 4.6 million subscribers.In 
             addition to gaming, Gawr Gura is known for her 
             humor and the down to earth way she interacts with 
             her fans. But everything changed on April 16, 2025.
             An emotional sounding Gura thanked her fans, expressing 
             the joy she had while going from "being too shy to sing 
             in the shower" to singing in front of "hundreds to thousands" 
             of fans. She said her departure was due to issues with "management."</p>

              In other instances, she has implied that Bloop isn't exactly a morally upstanding individual, 
              and is likely bordering on evil based on how she described his plush version.</h2>
